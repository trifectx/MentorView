I was able to find it at a nearby location and arranged for it to be transferred to our store. The customer was delighted with this solution, and it strengthened their loyalty to our store. I believe this experience reflects my commitment to going above and beyond for customers.\" \n\nThis response is professional, relevant, and directly addresses the question, demonstrating the candidate's ability to ensure customer satisfaction.",

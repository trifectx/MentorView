  "question": "Can you describe a situation where you had to deal with a difficult customer in a previous role? How did you handle it?",
  "answer": "Hi. I like Hornet. Thanks.",
  "feedback": "1. Overall assessment: 1/10\n2. Strengths of the answer: The candidate's answer does not address the question asked, and therefore, lacks any strengths in this context.\n3. Areas for improvement: The answer is not related to the question at all. The candidate should provide a response that directly addresses the question asked, which in this case, involves describing a past experience with a difficult customer and how they managed the situation.\n4. Suggestions for a better response: A better response would be, \"Certainly. In my previous role as a sales associate, I once encountered a customer who was very dissatisfied with a product they had purchased. They were upset and raising their voice. I remained calm and listened to their concerns, apologizing for their negative experience. I then explained our return policy and offered to help them find a similar product that might better meet their needs. In the end, the customer left satisfied and appreciated the assistance. I believe it's crucial to remain patient, empathetic, and solution-oriented when dealing with difficult customers.\""

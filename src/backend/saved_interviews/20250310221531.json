  "question": "At Costco, teamwork is key. Can you describe a situation where you collaborated with a team to accomplish a task?",
  "answer": "Hi. My name is Toto, and I like Fortnite.",
  "feedback": "1. Overall assessment: 1 out of 10\n2. Strengths of the answer: The candidate has introduced themselves which is polite and appropriate. \n3. Areas for improvement: The answer does not address the question at all. It is not related to teamwork, doesn't provide any example of collaboration, and doesn't show any understanding of the role they are applying for or its requirements.\n4. Suggestions for a better response: The candidate should provide an example from their previous experience where they effectively worked in a team to accomplish a task. They should describe the situation, their role in the team, how they collaborated with others, what obstacles they faced and how they overcame them, and what the end result was. For example, \"In my previous job at a retail store, we were short-staffed during a busy holiday season. I suggested we work together to divide tasks based on our strengths and schedules. I took the lead in coordinating our efforts and ensuring open communication among team members. Despite the challenges, we were able to serve our customers efficiently and achieve record sales.\""

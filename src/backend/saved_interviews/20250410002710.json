  "question": "Costco values high-quality products for our customers. As an Underwater Ceramics Officer, you'll need to ensure the quality of our ceramics even in underwater conditions. Can you please share a specific instance where you had to maintain strict quality control standards in a previous role and how you went about it?",
  "answer": "Yeah. So at Costco, we do value high quality products for our customers. And yeah. Like I said, my name is Rahi. I am an underwater ceramics officer. I like cleaning dishes, and it's been my passion from day one. I've always wanted to clean dishes, and instead of doing that, I'm stupidly going to do CS. But I'll be back cleaning dishes to one thirty. Thank you.",
  "feedback": "1. Overall assessment\nScore: 2/10\n\n2. Content strengths of the answer\nThe candidate's passion for cleaning dishes comes through, which is relevant for the role of an Underwater Ceramics Officer, assuming that the role involves maintaining and cleaning ceramics.\n\n3. Areas for improvement in content and delivery\nThe candidate failed to address the question directly. They did not provide a specific instance where they maintained strict quality control standards, which was the main focus of the question. The answer also veers off-topic with the mention of computer science (CS) and lacks professionalism.\n\n4. Language quality\nThe candidate uses filler words such as 'like' and 'so', which can be distracting and make the response seem less confident. The language used also lacks clarity and specificity.\n\n5. Speaking pace evaluation\nThe candidate's speaking pace was 126 words per minute, which falls within the optimal range. However, given the lack of clear content and structure, the pace did not aid in communicating the message effectively.\n\n6. Suggestions for a better response\nThe candidate should focus on answering the question directly and provide a specific instance of maintaining quality control standards. They should explain their role, the challenges they faced, how they addressed those challenges, and the outcome. They should maintain a professional tone throughout and avoid unnecessary details (like the mention of CS). The candidate could also work on reducing the use of filler words for a more confident delivery.",

  "question": "\"Costco is known for its commitment to customer satisfaction. Can you share an instance from your past work experience where you went above and beyond to ensure a customer was satisfied? How did you handle it and what was the outcome?\"",
  "answer": "Costco is known for its, um, commitment to customer, um, satisfaction. Can you, um, share an Internet from your, um, past experience when you went on above and beyond? Well, I'd say, um, a past experience, um, is, um, everyone, um, used to.",
  "feedback": "1. Overall Assessment:\nScore: 2/10\n\n2. Content Strengths of the Answer:\nUnfortunately, the candidate did not provide any content strengths in this answer. They did not give an instance of a past experience where they went above and beyond to ensure a customer was satisfied.\n\n3. Areas for Improvement in Content and Delivery:\nThe candidate did not answer the question asked. They should have shared a relevant experience from their past work where they went above and beyond to satisfy a customer. To improve, the candidate should focus on understanding the question clearly and providing a concise, relevant response.\n\n4. Language Quality:\nThe candidate used the filler word \"um\" 8 times, which is excessive and detracts from the clarity and flow of the response. To reduce the use of filler words, the candidate should practice speaking slowly and clearly, taking a moment to think before speaking. It may also be beneficial for the candidate to practice potential interview questions beforehand to improve their confidence and fluency.\n\n5. Speaking Pace Evaluation:\nThe candidate's Words Per Minute (WPM) was 66, which is considered slow. Although speaking slowly can sometimes help in reducing filler words and ensuring clarity, in this case, it contributed to the lack of content in the candidate's response.\n\n6. Suggestions for a Better Response:\nA better response would have directly addressed the question by providing a specific instance from the candidate's past work experience. For example, the candidate could have said, \"In my previous job at a retail store, a customer was looking for a specific product that we had run out of. I took the initiative to call other nearby stores, found the product, and arranged for the customer to pick it up at their convenience. The customer was very satisfied and appreciative of the effort I put in to meet their needs.\" This response would have demonstrated the candidate's commitment to customer satisfaction and their willingness to go above and beyond.",

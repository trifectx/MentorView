  "question": "As a Sample Associate, you'll be interacting with a variety of customers with different tastes and dietary restrictions. Can you share an instance where you had to adapt quickly to meet a customer's specific needs? What steps did you take and what was the outcome?",
  "answer": "Um, hi. Um, hi. Um, hi. Um, hi. Um, hi. Um, hi. Um, hi. Um, hi. Um, hi. Um, hi.",
  "feedback": "1. Overall assessment\nScore: 1/10\n\n2. Content strengths of the answer\nUnfortunately, the candidate did not provide any relevant content in response to the question asked.\n\n3. Areas for improvement in content and delivery\nThe main area for improvement would be to actually answer the question. It seems the candidate may have been nervous and therefore did not respond to the question at all. The candidate needs to share a specific experience that aligns with the question asked and explain how they handled the situation.\n\n4. Language quality\nThe candidate repeatedly used the filler word \"um\" and did not offer any other language. The use of filler words can be reduced by taking a moment to gather thoughts before responding, this can also help in providing a more structured and focused answer.\n\n5. Speaking pace evaluation\nThe speaking pace was very slow, as the candidate only said \"um, hi\" repeatedly. The candidate needs to improve on this by practicing to speak more naturally and at a moderate pace.\n\n6. Suggestions for a better response\nThe candidate should have responded with a real-life example where they had to adapt to meet a customer's specific needs. For instance, \"At my previous job in a restaurant, I had a customer who had severe food allergies. I had to quickly consult with the kitchen staff to modify a dish and ensure it was safe for the customer. The customer was very appreciative of our efforts and left a positive review. This experience taught me the importance of being adaptable and attentive to customers' needs.\"",

  "question": "Can you describe a situation where you had to work as part of a team to accomplish a task or goal, and what was your role?",
  "answer": "This is a very bad interview.",
  "feedback": "1. Overall assessment: 1/10\n\n2. Content strengths of the answer: Unfortunately, the candidate did not provide any content related to the question asked. \n\n3. Areas for improvement in content and delivery: The candidate needs to focus on the question and provide a relevant answer. The response given shows a lack of professionalism and preparation. It is important for the candidate to understand the importance of each question and respond accordingly. \n\n4. Language quality: The candidate used very few words, none of which answered the question or provided any meaningful content. No filler words were used because no proper answer was given. \n\n5. Speaking pace evaluation: The speaking pace was too slow given the brevity of the candidate's response. However, as the provided answer contains no substance or relevance to the interview question, the speaking pace is the least of the issues here.\n\n6. Suggestions for a better response: A better response would involve the candidate sharing a specific experience where they worked as part of a team to accomplish a task. They should describe the situation, their role within the team, the actions they took, and the outcome of the situation. This would demonstrate their ability to work effectively in a team setting, which is crucial for a position at Costco. For example, \"In my previous role at XYZ, we had a big holiday sale coming up. I was a part of the merchandising team. My role was to strategize and execute the display of products. We worked together to ensure the products were appealing to customers. The sale ended up being a huge success, with a 25% increase in sales compared to the previous year. This experience taught me the importance of teamwork and collaboration.\"",

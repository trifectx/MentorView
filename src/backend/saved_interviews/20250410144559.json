  "question": "As a Sample Associate, you will be expected to interact with a diverse range of customers. Can you describe a time when you had to adjust your communication style to accommodate a customer\u2019s needs?",
  "answer": "Um, I'm a currently a sample associate, and I think that all some of your associates aren't good at their job. That's what I think, and you can't really change what I think. And you might say I'm a hard headed person, but I'm trying to get as fast as I can in my word per minute so I can probably get a job. Can I get a job or not? I don't know. But that is something that you're not gonna stop me doing. So I don't really think that that's something you should stop me from doing, and I should stop me doing anything. So I hope that can help.",
  "feedback": "1. Overall Assessment: \nScore: 2/10 \n\n2. Content Strengths:\nThe candidate did display honesty and openness about their personal opinion. They also showed some determination in trying to improve their speed in delivering their words. \n\n3. Areas for Improvement in Content and Delivery:\nThe candidate did not answer the question directly and instead expressed their personal opinion about other sample associates. They also did not give any examples of their past experiences, which was what the question asked for. It is crucial to stay on topic and answer the question directly. The candidate also came off as defensive and confrontational, which may not leave a positive impression. \n\n4. Language Quality:\nThe use of filler words is minimal, but the language used was not professional. The candidate seemed to ramble without clear direction or intention in their answer. It's important to think through the answer before speaking to reduce the chance of rambling and to maintain a professional tone.\n\n5. Speaking Pace Evaluation:\nThe speaking pace was too fast (204 words per minute). A good rate of speech in business communication typically ranges from 120 - 150 words per minute. The candidate should slow down their speaking pace to ensure clear and effective communication.\n\n6. Suggestions for a Better Response:\nA better approach to this question would be to think of a specific example when the candidate had to adapt their communication style to meet a customer's needs. This could include a time when they had to explain a complex product to a customer, or when they had to handle a difficult customer with patience and understanding. Remember, it's crucial to answer the question directly and to provide examples that highlight relevant skills and experiences.",

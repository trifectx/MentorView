  "question": "Can you share a time when you went above and beyond the call of duty to help a customer in your previous role?",
  "answer": "One time I went above and beyond the call of duty to help a customer. My previous role was actually my role as a software engineer at Costco. Now the task that was presented to me was I had to essentially just give a customer a badge. And, um, yeah, the badge was meant to be hand delivered, but I didn't actually get to hand deliver it to them. And so when I was trying to hand deliver it to them, it didn't really work out as I planned to. So what I did instead was I actually personally went to his house and I gave it to him. And the reason why this is so good is because it allowed me to understand the customer's needs and wants. And, eventually, he got it, and he was a lot happier than he would have if I just delivered it to him. And I'd say I'd be able to bring those skills into Costco as well.",
  "feedback": "1. Overall Assessment: \nI would rate this answer a 6 out of 10.\n\n2. Content Strengths:\nThe candidate provided a clear example of going above and beyond for a customer, which shows initiative and commitment. The description of the situation shows that the candidate is willing to take extra steps to ensure customer satisfaction.\n\n3. Areas for Improvement in Content and Delivery:\nThe response could be more polished and structured. There was a lack of clarity on why the badge was important, why it needed to be hand-delivered, and what the customer's reaction was. The candidate also needs to improve the connection between this experience and the position they're applying for at Costco.\n\n4. Language Quality:\nThe candidate uses some filler words, notably 'actually' and 'so,' which could be reduced to make the answer sound more confident and professional. The usage of the word 'um' only once is not concerning.\n\n5. Speaking Pace Evaluation:\nThe speaking pace of 153 WPM is within the optimal range. It's fast enough to keep the listener engaged but also slow enough to ensure comprehension.\n\n6. Suggestions for a Better Response:\nThe candidate should focus on providing more context and details about the situation. For example, why was it so important that the badge had to be hand-delivered? How did the customer react when the candidate personally delivered it? The candidate should also make a clear link between this experience and the skills required for the Costco Sample Associate position. Overall, the response could be more effective with a clear structure: Situation, Task, Action, and Result (STAR method).",

  "question": "Tell us about a time when you had to develop a software solution under tight deadlines. How did you ensure the quality of the software wasn't compromised due to the time constraint?",
  "answer": "Um, I'd say a time when I had to develop a software solution on the tight deadline, um, and how I was able to ensure the quality of my software wasn't compromising the time constraint was, um, actually at my first role when I was working at, um, Aviva. Now I actually had to create a software, and it was pretty good, but it took a long time. And so he the manager told me to make it shorter really quickly. And so but he gave me that over.",
  "feedback": "1. Overall assessment\nScore: 3/10\n\n2. Content strengths of the answer\nThe candidate provided a specific example from their previous experience, which is always a good practice while answering behavioral questions.\n\n3. Areas for improvement in content and delivery\nThe answer is not well-structured and lacks critical details. It's unclear how the candidate ensured the quality of the software while working under a tight deadline. The candidate should clearly outline the steps taken to complete the project within the given timeline without sacrificing quality. Also, the delivery could be improved by eliminating filler words and providing more concise responses.\n\n4. Language quality\nThe candidate used too many filler words (\"um\", \"actually\", \"so\") which can be distracting and may imply a lack of confidence or preparedness. The candidate should practice to slow down, take a brief pause instead of using filler words.\n\n5. Speaking pace evaluation\nThe candidate's Words Per Minute (WPM) is in the optimal range. However, the clarity could be improved by slowing down a bit and focusing on articulating thoughts clearly.\n\n6. Suggestions for a better response\nA better response would include a specific example of a project they worked on, the challenges they faced because of the tight deadline, the steps they took to manage their time effectively, techniques they used to ensure the quality of the software, and the result of their work. Here is an example:\n\n\"When I was working at Aviva, we were tasked with developing a new software solution within a very tight deadline. I started by breaking down the project into smaller, manageable tasks, and estimated the time required for each task. I prioritized tasks based on their importance and dependencies. To ensure the quality, I incorporated automated testing into the development process which helped us identify and fix bugs early. Despite the tight deadline, we were able to deliver a high-quality software on time.\"",

  "answer": "An example of situation I had to deal with difficult customers at my last job at Maryland. Maryland, that was a re a customer that was really, um, annoyed at what I was doing. And even though it was what was company procedure, she was getting angry at me. So I had to take a step back and ask her what was going on while she getting angry.

  "feedback": "1. Overall Assessment:\nI would give this response a score of 5 out of 10.\n\n2. Content Strengths:\nThe candidate shared an experience involving a difficult customer, which is relevant to the question. The candidate also demonstrated an understanding of the importance of following company procedures and having good communication with dissatisfied customers.\n\n3. Areas for Improvement in Content and Delivery:\nThe candidate\u2019s response lacks detail and clarity. It would have been better if the candidate could provide a more specific instance of a difficult customer interaction, including the steps taken to resolve the issue. It's unclear what the situation exactly was, what the company's procedure was, and how the candidate managed to calm the customer down. The response was cut-off and incomplete, which leaves the listener with many unanswered questions.\n\n4. Language Quality:\nThe candidate used a few filler words, which can be distracting and detracts from the overall clarity of the response. However, the usage is not excessively high. The candidate could work on reducing this by pausing briefly to collect thoughts instead of using filler words.\n\n5. Speaking Pace Evaluation:\nThe candidate's speaking pace is optimal at 154 WPM as it falls within the average conversational speed (125-175 WPM). This allows the listener to follow along without feeling rushed or lost.\n\n6. Suggestions for a Better Response:\nA more effective response would include a clear, concise recounting of a specific situation, the actions taken to address the customer's concerns, and the results of those actions. The candidate could also mention any lessons learned from the experience. For example, \"At my previous job, I encountered a customer who was upset because a product they purchased was defective. Despite my explanation of our return policy, they became increasingly frustrated. Recognizing their distress, I calmly reiterated our policy, empathized with their situation, and offered a viable solution like replacing the item or issuing a refund. Ultimately, the customer was satisfied and even thanked me for my patience and understanding. This experience taught me the importance of remaining calm and patient under pressure, and the value of effective communication in resolving customer complaints.\"",

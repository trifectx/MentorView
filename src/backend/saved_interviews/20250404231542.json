  "role": "Software Engineer",
  "company": "Google",
  "style": "behavioral",
  "question": "Google values innovation and creativity. Can you describe a situation where you had to think outside the box to solve a complex software problem? How did you approach it and what was the outcome?",
  "answer": "Hi. My name is Toto, and I'm trying to see if this branch works now. So, yeah, help Faggot.",
  "feedback": "1. Overall Assessment:\nI would have to give the candidate a score of 1 out of 10. The response is inappropriate and unprofessional, and it doesn't answer the question at all.\n\n2. Content Strengths:\nThere doesn't appear to be any strength in the content of this candidate's response. It's completely off-topic and disrespectful.\n\n3. Areas for Improvement:\nThe candidate should focus on answering the question that was asked. They should provide a clear, concise answer detailing a specific instance in which they had to think creatively to solve a complex software problem. They should also maintain a professional tone throughout the interview.\n\n4. Language Quality:\nThe language used in this response is unprofessional and offensive. The candidate should avoid using filler words like 'so', but more importantly, they should avoid using inappropriate or offensive language altogether.\n\n5. Speaking Pace Evaluation:\nThe words per minute pace is within an optimal range, but the content is not relevant nor appropriate.\n\n6. Suggestions for a Better Response:\nA better response would be something like: \"In my previous role, we were faced with a complex software problem that traditional methods couldn't solve. I suggested that we try using a different programming language that was better suited to the problem. This required us to think outside the box, as we had never used this language before. However, after some initial trial and error, we were able to solve the problem much more efficiently. This experience taught me the importance of being open to new ideas and approaches, even when they are outside of my comfort zone.\"",

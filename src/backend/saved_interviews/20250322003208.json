  "question": "Scenario:\nYour group is composed of product managers at Amazon who have been tasked with the development of a new feature for the Amazon website. The feature is a new recommendation engine that uses machine learning to better suggest products to customers based on their previous purchases and browsing history. However, you have a limited amount of resources and must decide on the key aspects of the feature to prioritize.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Each participant should adopt a different perspective (e.g., user experience, technical feasibility, strategic value, cost, etc.) and argue for prioritizing certain aspects of the feature over others.\n2. Discuss and list the key objectives of the new feature (e.g., increase customer engagement, boost sales, improve customer satisfaction).\n3. Negotiate with the other \"product managers\" in the group to come up with a balanced development plan that takes into account all perspectives.\n4. The group should then work together to draft a project plan that outlines the agreed-upon priorities, resource allocation, and development timeline.\n5. Prepare a short presentation explaining your group's final decision that will be presented to the assessors.\n\nThis task should take approximately 30 minutes to complete. The aim is to evaluate the candidates' abilities in leadership, teamwork, communication, problem-solving, and decision-making.",

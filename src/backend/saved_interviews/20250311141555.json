  "question": "Can you describe a situation where you had to deal with a difficult customer? How did you handle it and what was the outcome?",
  "answer": "Can you describe such a way you had to deal with a different customer? One of the times I had to deal with a different customer when I was at work last week, and she was getting really angry at me because I wasn't giving her the food that she wanted. And so rather than getting angry, I tried to really assess why she was getting angry. And after assessing it, I realized that there was a issue in the food that she had gotten and that it was very cold, but the fact that she was expressing in a very bad way made me not wanna take on her request. So I ignored how I felt because I tried to understand it from her perspective. And when I came to that conclusion that it was cold, I just went to hear over food. I apologize to her, deescalate the situation. And as a result of that, she was actually pretty happy with the situation. She then came back to me after and apologized and said that she was just quite angry because she hadn't eaten in a long time. This was her first meal. And, yeah, we can deescalate the situation. And so I think this had plays a big role in my, um, in just me and my character building as a person. And so when I'm moving into a role like a sample associate at Costco, when I'm trying to learn all of these new skills that a sample associate associate would need, when I'm dealing with difficult situations like the one I just experienced, it wouldn't be so hard, and I'll be able to add value to the company. Thanks.",
  "feedback": "1. Overall Assessment: \n7 out of 10\n\n2. Content Strengths of the Answer: \nThe candidate provides a specific example of dealing with a difficult customer which is good. They detail their thought process during the situation, how they handled it, and what the outcome was. The candidate also makes a good effort to relate their experience to the position they're applying for, demonstrating how the skills they've learnt would be applicable as a Sample Associate at Costco.\n\n3. Areas for Improvement in Content and Delivery: \nThe answer is a bit lengthy and convoluted. The candidate could have been more concise in their explanation, and could improve the flow and coherence of their answer. The candidate also needs to work on how they present their story, as it was a little disjointed and confusing at times.\n\n4. Language Quality: \nThe candidate used a few filler words ('um', 'like', 'actually', 'so') which indicates a degree of nervousness or lack of preparation. Reducing these would improve the fluency and professionalism of the response.\n\n5. Speaking Pace Evaluation: \nAt 215 words per minute, the candidate is speaking too fast. This rapid pace, combined with the use of filler words and a lack of clear structure, made the response hard to follow.\n\n6. Suggestions for a Better Response: \nThe candidate should practice structuring their responses in a clear, concise manner. A useful format could be: Situation, Task, Action, Result (STAR). They should also aim to speak more slowly and clearly, which will make their response easier to follow and understand. Here's a revised version of the response:\n\n\"Recently, I had an encounter with a customer who was upset because her meal was served cold. I could tell she was frustrated, so I calmly acknowledged her feelings and apologized for the inconvenience. I immediately arranged for a fresh, hot meal to be served to her. She was relieved and expressed her gratitude. From this experience, I learned the importance of empathy and prompt action in customer service, skills that I believe would be valuable in a Sample Associate role at Costco.\"",

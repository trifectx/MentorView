  "question": "Costco is known for its high level of customer service. Can you provide an example from your past experience where you went beyond the call of duty to assist a customer? What was the situation and what actions did you take?",
  "answer": "Now I'm going to be honest with you. I said those bad ones before, and they were very bad. But on my life, on my soul, I genuinely love all Indians, and I love all Asians. Like, on God, bro. The people I'm doing this two project with are Asian. I just wanted to see how I just wanted to see how this cost this interview thing would react when you say very racial racially aggravated stuff. I've done the same thing for, like, black people and stuff as well. Hand on my heart, I genuinely do not hate Asians on the bible. Thank you.",
  "feedback": "1. Overall Assessment:\nScore: 1/10\n\n2. Content Strengths of the Answer:\nUnfortunately, this answer has no relevant content strengths as it does not address the question asked about customer service experience.\n\n3. Areas for Improvement in Content and Delivery:\nThe content of the response was completely off-topic and did not answer the question asked at all. The candidate brought up unrelated and inappropriate topics, which are not professional or suitable for a job interview. The response should be focused on the question asked, which was about a specific experience with customer service. The candidate should also refrain from using informal language such as \"bro\" and \"on God\" in a professional interview.\n\n4. Language Quality:\nThe use of filler words was minimal in this response, but the overall language quality was poor due to the use of slang and inappropriate content. The candidate should use more professional language in their responses.\n\n5. Speaking Pace Evaluation:\nThe candidate's speaking pace was too fast, at 176 words per minute. A more appropriate pace would be between 120-150 words per minute, depending on the complexity of the response.\n\n6. Suggestions for a Better Response:\nA better response would be to fully address the question asked, providing a specific example of a time when they went above and beyond to assist a customer. For example: \"In my previous role at a retail store, I once had a customer who was looking for a specific item that we were out of stock on. Instead of simply telling her we didn't have it, I took the initiative to call our other locations to see if they had the item. I ended up finding it at another store and arranged for the customer to pick it up there. She was very appreciative of the extra effort I put in to assist her.\" This response is professional, relevant, and showcases the candidate's commitment to excellent customer service.",

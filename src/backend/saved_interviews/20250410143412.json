  "question": "Costco highly values teamwork and collaboration. Can you share an instance when you were working as part of a team and faced a significant challenge? How did you handle it and what was the outcome?",
  "answer": "Hi. This is the answer to my interview. Um, it's going alright, I guess. I don't really know how it I'm going to do this, but I guess I'm going to try my best, I think.",
  "feedback": "1. Overall Assessment:\nScore: 2/10\n\n2. Content Strengths of the Answer:\nUnfortunately, the candidate's response does not contain any strengths. The candidate does not provide an answer to the question asked.\n\n3. Areas for Improvement in Content and Delivery:\nThe candidate's answer is vague, without any specific examples or experiences. The candidate does not address the question asked about teamwork, challenges, and the outcome of a situation. The candidate should focus on providing a specific instance that answers the question directly.\n\n4. Language Quality:\nThe candidate uses a filler word 'um' once. Although the use of filler words is minimal, the language used is informal and lacks clarity. The candidate should aim to speak more professionally and confidently.\n\n5. Speaking Pace Evaluation:\nThe candidate's speaking pace is slow with a WPM of 61, which might indicate nervousness or lack of preparation. Practicing responses and being more familiar with potential interview questions can help increase the WPM and confidence.\n\n6. Suggestions for a Better Response:\nA better response would be: \"At my previous job, I was part of a team responsible for restocking the shelves. One particular day, we were short-staffed and had a huge shipment that needed to be on the shelves before the store opened the next day. I suggested we split the workload by departments, and everyone agreed. I also stepped in to help the team member who was handling the heaviest department. We managed to finish the task on time. This experience taught me the importance of teamwork and effective communication in overcoming challenges.\" This response directly answers the question, provides a specific instance, and reflects on the outcome.",
